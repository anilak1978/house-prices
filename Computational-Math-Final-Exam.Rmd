# Problem 1

Using R, generate a random variable X that has 10,000 random uniform numbers from 1 to N, where N can be any number of your choosing greater than or equal to 6.  Then generate a random variable Y that has 10,000 random normal numbers with a mean of $\mu=\sigma=(N+1)/2$

## Generate Random Variable X

```{r}

N <- runif(1,6,100)
n <- 10000
X <- runif(n, min=0, max=N)

hist(X)


```

## Generate Random Variable Y


```{r}
m <- (N+1)/2 # mean
sd <- (N+1)/2 # standard deviation
n <- 10000 # number of trials
Y <- rnorm(n, m, sd)
hist(Y)


```

## Probability

Calculate as a minimum the below probabilities a through c.  Assume the small letter "x" is estimated as the median of the X variable, and the small letter "y" is estimated as the 1st quartile of the Y variable.  Interpret the meaning of all probabilities.

**x is median of X**

**y is 1st quartile of Y**

(a) $P(X>x | X>y)$ => Probability of X is greater than median of X given that X is greater than first quartile of Y. 

```{r}

x <- median(X)
y <- quantile(Y, 0.25)[[1]]
x
y


```

$P(X>x | X>y)=\frac{P(X>x, X>y)}{P(X>y)}$


$P(X>x, X>y)$ => sum of all the posibilities where X >x and X > y , divided by all the possibilities for X

$P(X>y)$ => sum of all the possibilities where X>y, divided by all the possibilities for x

```{r}
p_1 <- sum(X>x & X >y)/n
p_2 <- sum(X>y)/n
p_3 <- p_1/p_2
p_3

```

**This means the probability of X being greater than X's median given X being greater than Y's first quartile is 60%**


(b) $P(X>x, Y>y)$ => Probability of X is greater than all possible median of X and Y is greater than all possible quantile of Y.

$P(X>x, Y>y)$ => Sum of all the possibilities where X>x and Y>y, divided by all the possibilities of X

```{r}
p_4 <- sum(X>x & Y>y)/n
p_4


```

**This means the probability of X being greater than median of X and Y being greater than first quartile of Y is 37%**


(c) $P(X<x | X>y)$ => Probability of X is smaller than median of X and X is greater than first quantile of Y.

$P(X<x, X>y)$ => Sum of all the possibilities where X < x and X > y, divided by all the possibilities of X

```{r}
p_5 <- sum(X<x & X>y)/n
p_5



```

**This means the probability of X being smaller than median of X and X being greater than first quartile of Y is 34%**


## Investigate Condition.

Investigate whether P(X>x and Y>y)=P(X>x)P(Y>y) by building a table and evaluating the marginal and joint probabilities.

```{r}
a <- sum(X>x & Y<y) # all possibilities where X >x and Y>y
b <- sum(X>x & Y>y) # all possibilities where X>x and Y<y
c <- sum(X<x & Y<y) # all possibilities where X<x and Y<y
d <- sum(X<x & Y>y) # all possibilities where X<x and Y>y
total_1 <- a+c
total_2 <- b+d
total_3 <- a+b
total_4 <- c+d
total_5 <- total_3+total_4

p_a <- a/n
p_b <- b/n
p_c <- c/n
p_d <- d/n
p_total_1 <- total_1/n
p_total_2 <- total_2/n
p_total_3 <- total_3/n
p_total_4 <- total_4/n
p_total_5 <- total_5/n

conditions_table <- matrix(c(p_a, p_b, p_total_3, p_c, p_d, p_total_4, p_total_1, p_total_2, p_total_5), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
conditions_df <- as.data.frame(conditions_table)
names(conditions_df) <- c("X>x", "X<x", "Total")
row.names(conditions_df) <- c("Y<y", "Y>y", "Total")

conditions_df

```

Based on the table $P(X>x and Y>y)=0.372$ and $P(X>x)P(Y>y)=0.5*0.75=0.375$ .

## Independence Fisher's Exact Test and Chi Square Test

**Check to see if independence holds by using Fisherâ€™s Exact Test and the Chi Square Test.  What is the difference between the two? Which is most appropriate?**

```{r}
matrix <- matrix(c(a,b,c,d), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

fisher.test(matrix, simulate.p.value = TRUE)

```


```{r}

chisq.test(matrix, correct=TRUE)


```

We use Fisher's Exact Test if the sample size is small. We use Chi-Squared test as it will be more accurate in this case.

## Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

Provide univariate descriptive statistics and appropriate plots for the training data set.  Provide a scatterplot matrix for at least two of the independent variables and the dependent variable. Derive a correlation matrix for any three quantitative variables in the dataset.  Test the hypotheses that the correlations between each pairwise set of variables is 0 and provide an 80% confidence interval.  Discuss the meaning of your analysis.  Would you be worried about familywise error? Why or why not?


### Descriptive Statistics and Plots for Training Dataset

df_train_1 <- select(df_train, Id, SalePrice, LotArea, YearBuilt, OverallCond, OverallQual)
head(df_train_1)

df_test_1 <- select(df_test, Id, LotArea, YearBuilt, OverallCond, OverallQual)



```

```{r}
corr <- cor(df_train_1)

ggcorrplot(corr, hc.order=TRUE,
           type = "lower",
           lab=TRUE,
           lab_size = 3,
           method = "circle",
           colors = c("tomato2", "white", "springgreen3"),
           title = "Correlogram of House Train Data Set",
           ggtheme=theme_bw())


```

```{r}
theme_set(theme_bw())
ggplot(df_train_1, aes(OverallQual, SalePrice))+
  geom_jitter(width=10, size=1)




```



## Hypotheses 

$H_{0}$ : The correlations between each pairwise set of variables is 0. 

Confidence interval is 80%. 

1- Look at the p-value of each variable that is in df_train_1 for correlation
2- 0.80 is the confidence level.

(a): Sale Price Vs OverallQual

```{r}

cor.test(df_train_1$SalePrice, df_train_1$OverallQual, conf.level = 0.80)

```


(b): Sale Price VS YearBuilt

```{r}

cor.test(df_train_1$SalePrice, df_train_1$YearBuilt , conf.level = 0.80)

```

(c): Sale Price VS LotArea

```{r}

cor.test(df_train_1$SalePrice, df_train_1$LotArea  , conf.level = 0.80)

```

### Discuss the Meaning

We are 80% confident that , with low P value for LotArea, YearBuilt and OverallQuall are somehow correlated to SalePrice.

## Linear Algebra and Correlation

Invert your correlation matrix from above. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.) Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix. Conduct LU decomposition on the matrix.


### Precision Matrix


**Invert your correlation matrix from above. (This is known as the precision matrix and contains variance inflation factors on the diagonal.)**

```{r}
library(MASS)
precision_matrix <- solve(corr)
precision_matrix


```

### Multiply correlation and precision Matrix

** Multiply the correlation matrix by the precision matrix, and then multiply the precision matrix by the correlation matrix.**


```{r}

mult_1 <- corr %*% precision_matrix
mult_2 <- precision_matrix %*% corr
mult_1
mult_2



```

### LU Decomposition on the Matrix 

**Conduct LU decomposition on the matrix.**

```{r}
library(matrixcalc)

```

```{r}
lu_matrix <- lu.decomposition(precision_matrix)

## Calculus-Based Probability & Statistics

Many times, it makes sense to fit a closed form distribution to data.  Select a variable in the Kaggle.com training dataset that is skewed to the right, shift it so that the minimum value is absolutely above zero if necessary.  Then load the MASS package and run fitdistr to fit an exponential probability density function.  (See  https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html ).  Find the optimal value of $\lambda$ for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this exponential distribution using this value (e.g., rexp(1000, $\lambda$)).  Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your original variable.   Using the exponential pdf, find the 5th and 95th percentiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).   Also generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data, assuming normality.  Finally, provide the empirical 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the data.  Discuss.

**Find the optimal value of $\lambda$ for this distribution, and then take 1000 samples from this exponential distribution using this value (e.g., rexp(1000, $\lambda$)).  Plot a histogram and compare it with a histogram of your original variable. **

```{r}

opt <- fit$estimate
dist <- rexp(1000, opt)
hist(dist, breaks=50)
hist(lot_area, breaks = 100)

```

**Using the exponential pdf, find the 5th and 95th percentiles using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).**


```{r}

quantile(dist, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))


```

**Also generate a 95% confidence interval from the empirical data, assuming normality.**

```{r}

mean(lot_area)
normal_dist <- rnorm(length(lot_area), mean(lot_area), sd(lot_area))
hist(normal_dist, breaks = 100)
quantile(normal_dist, probs = c(0.05, 0.95))

```

**Finally, provide the empirical 5th percentile and 95th percentile of the data**

```{r}

quantile(lot_area, probs = c(0.05, 0.095))


```


## Modeling

Build some type of multiple regression  model and submit your model to the competition board.  Provide your complete model summary and results with analysis.  Report your Kaggle.com user name and score.


```{r}

head(df_train_1)

```

## Model Development

```{r}


linear_model <- lm(df_train_1$SalePrice ~ df_train_1$LotArea + df_train_1$YearBuilt + df_train_1$OverallCond + df_train_1$OverallQual)
summary(linear_model)

```

## Model Evaluation

```{r}
qqnorm(linear_model$residuals)
qqline(linear_model$residuals)


```

```{r}

hist(linear_model$residuals, breaks = 100)

```



```{r}

sale_price <- function (LotArea, YearBuilt, OverallCond, OverallQual){
  sale_price <- (-7.984e+05 + 1.500e+00*LotArea + 3.572e+02*YearBuilt + 2.736e+03 * OverallCond + 4.003e+04 * OverallQual)
  return(sale_price)
}

bckwrd <- sale_price(df_train_1$LotArea, df_train_1$YearBuilt, df_train_1$OverallCond, df_train_1$OverallQual)

comparison <-data.frame(df_train_1$SalePrice, bckwrd, bckwrd - df_train_1$SalePrice)

```

```{r}
prediction <- predict(linear_model, df_test_1)

predict_df <- data.frame(Id=df_test_1$Id,SalePrice=prediction)

predict_df$SalePrice <- ifelse(predict_df$SalePrice < 0,0,predict_df$SalePrice)

#export to csv
#write.csv(predict_df, "prediction_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

**Prediction are submitted to Kaggle for results**
